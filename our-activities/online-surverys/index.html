                <p>Even though we can make a huge difference if we try to, in some situations we cannot really take any action but what we can do is gather as much information as we can and spread awareness amongst people. So, as a part of this initiative, we conduct surveys  on topics which are crucial for the society and where people can voice their views without the fear of being exposed. After the surveys, we formulate proper reports to analysis the gathered data and the current situation of our society and then some initiatives that could be taken by the government and the people to improve the situation. </p>

                <p>Menstrual hygiene is not something that can be taken lightly. It is a grave issue that causes various health problems to thousands of girls every year. Be it a rural area or an urban, it is still seen as a taboo by millions of people and the women are outcasted and treated as degenerates. By conducting this survey we aim to gather information on the level of basic knowledge about menstrual hygiene amongst the people of our country, old and young. We hope to spread some awareness and make people realise that it’s time we let go of these prejudiced old traditions and rituals and accept menstruation as a healthy biological process that is completely normal and in fact, necessary for a healthy functioning of the female body.
