                The topic of the campaign is: “To raise awareness about the government schemes aimed for the welfare of the underprivileged to them.” These schemes play a pivotal role in the development of our country. However, many people for whom these are made, are unaware of them as they are barely able to make ends meet. Hence, through this campaign, we wish to ensure that we can educate as many people as possible to attain full benefit of the schemes government has made for them.

                  We've all got clothes that we don't wear anymore. It could be the shirt you stopped wearing when college ended or the denims that don't fit anymore. Whatever it is, you know you're hoarding something that's of no use to you. These clothes could be the reason for someone's unmatched joy. So, do a good deed today and give away the clothes you don't use anymore Team AAF organised a clothes distribution drive many volunteers become a part of it and experienced the joy of giving.

                  Did you know that countless people in your community and across the globe go barefoot everyday because they can’t afford to buy shoes? People who aren’t able to afford the basic necessity of a proper footwear are prone to so many injuries and diseases. Growing children in the early ages wear out shoes quickly and need new ones more often than their families might be able to afford. Donating your new or even gently worn out shoes can really make a difference to someone in need!

                <p>The awareness campaign that was carried out in Shalimar Gaon on 13th july was about the various schemes that  are available for all the age groups of girls by the Central Government in order to provide them with  the satisfaction of financial support. Evidently, the government launches new schemes pertaining to  every aspect of the nation but more importantly for the women who are still dependent on other sources for monetary support. However, the availability of such schemes to the women are lesser known in areas where there is a comparatively lower rate of literacy.
